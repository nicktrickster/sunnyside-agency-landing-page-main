- CSS Variables (HSL color values)
- CSS Transitions (For hover effects)
- Modern CSS selectors and pseudo-elements
3. Responsive Design Features:
- Mobile-first workflow
- Breakpoints at 768px and 375px
- Flexible layouts using relative units
- Responsive images and typography
4. External Resources:
- Google Fonts (Barlow and Fraunces fonts)
- Custom images and SVG icons
- Frontend Mentor challenge assets

### What I learned

"Through this project, I gained practical experience implementing modern CSS layout techniques, specifically mastering the combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox for creating responsive, dynamic layouts. I deepened my understanding of CSS pseudo-elements, particularly the ::after selector, utilizing it for creating interactive underline animations and decorative elements. This included implementing custom hover effects and managing element positioning through absolute and relative positioning techniques. Additionally, I learned to create fluid layouts that gracefully adapt across different viewport sizes while maintaining design integrity and user experience."

Key technical points covered:
- CSS Grid for gallery layouts
- Flexbox for component alignment and responsive containers
- Pseudo-element manipulation for interactive UI elements
- Complex selector patterns
- Responsive design principles
- CSS transitions and animations

```css

.tranform-col1 a::after,
    .standout-col2 a::after {
      content: '';
      position: absolute;
      left: 95px;
      right: 95px;
      bottom: 1px;
      height: 5px;
      border-radius: 12px;
      z-index: -1;
      transition: height 0.3s ease;
    }
    .tranform-col1 a:hover::after,
    .standout-col2 a:hover::after {
      height: 6px;
    }
    .gallery-section {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
      gap: 0;
    }

    @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
    .gallery-section {
        grid-template-columns: repeat(1, 1fr);
      }
    }
```
### Continued development
